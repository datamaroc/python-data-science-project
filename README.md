# Python Data Science Project

A comprehensive Python project for performing basic data processing and calculations. This project demonstrates how to:
- Perform simple calculations (e.g., summing numbers).
- Parse raw CSV-like data into structured dictionaries.
- Handle errors gracefully, ensuring the application doesn't crash unexpectedly.
- Follow **PEP 8** conventions for clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## Features
- Sum two numbers with error handling.
- Parse CSV data and convert it to a list of dictionaries.
- Handle errors for invalid data formats.
- Example usage of **PEP 8** standards (proper indentation, meaningful variable names, docstrings).
- Demonstrates basic Python functions, type annotations, and modular coding practices.
